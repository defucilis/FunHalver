Hello everyone, my name is Defucilis and I am not a cock hero. If you're anything like me, there are a whole bunch of scripts for videos that you'd love to watch but there's just no way that you're able to last through the whole video. You can always reduce the stroke length, but where's the fun in that?

I wrote this utility application that can make any script twice as easy, without sacrificing perfect synchronization...sort of. It turns each up/down stroke into a single up and/or down stroke.

Just drag any .funscript file into the app and instantly have a half-speed .funscript that you can save wherever you like!

Features:

  * Works on any funscript
  * Maintains stroke timing
  * Maintains stroke positions (generally)
  * Respects pauses
  * Heatmap preview (thanks @Lucifie!)
  * Funscript shape preview - pink is the half-speed script, white is the original script
  * No internet connection required

Planned Features:

  * User-configurable options to fine-tune
  * Respect speed modulations for intermediate funscript actions
  * Mac + Linux support...maybe

Ideal For:

  * Running scripts designed for Handy / OSR2 on Launch
  * Last through hard-mode Cock Hero videos
  * Last through long VR scripts
  *  Last through any script which is too hard for you right now!
